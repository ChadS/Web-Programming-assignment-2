<h2>Directions:</h2>

<div>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm milk. Add the sugar, salt, butter, sour cream, eggs and 3 cups flour. 
        Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be sticky).
        </li>

        <li>
            Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. 
            Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour
        </li>

        <li>
            Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, combine the sugar, butter, egg and cinnamon. 
            Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. 
            Remove from the heat; gently stir in walnuts and apple. Cool completely.
        </li>

        <li>
            Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into four portions. Roll each into a 12x10-in. rectangle. 
            Spread filling to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seams to seal. 
            Place seam side down on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake at 350Â° for 30-40 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool. Combine icing ingredients; drizzle over loaves.
        </li>
