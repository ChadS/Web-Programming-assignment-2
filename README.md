<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This assignment tests your understanding of basic XHTML and CSS. You will
  create two XHTML web pages and a CSS file from content borrowed from the
  World's Healthiest Food web site. Note: Educational Fair Use guidelines permit
  this limited use of copyrighted material.
</p>
<p>
  Create the following files in .public folder
  <b> program\assignments\recipe.html\ (this is an example)</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>program1.html</b>, the front home page for these two web pages (with an
    optional CSS style sheet file)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>recipe.html</b>, the second of two web pages containing a recipe for
    15-minute garbanzo bean salad
  </li>
  <li><b>program1.css</b>, the external style sheet for both pages</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You may use an additional, optional CSS style sheet for program1.html
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>program1.html</h2>

<p>
  The first part of your task is to create a front page for this web site,
  stored in a file named <b>program1.html</b>. Your front page must contain a
  <b>navigation bar</b> which links to itself and to <b>recipe.html</b> file
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The file must also be at least 20 lines long and must contain at least 4
    different XHTML elements in its body
  </li>
  <li>
    It may not significantly borrow content from your recipe.html or other
    pages. The intent is for you to create content, not copy and paste. Be
    creative and fun!
  </li>
  <li>Its overall look should be set by <b>program1.css</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you like, you may use an additional optional CSS stylesheet with this
      page named front.css and submit it with your other files. Be creative and
      fun!
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>recipe.html</h2>
<p>
  The second (and more substantial) part of the assignment is to create a
  specific web page describing a recipe for 15-minute garbanzo bean salad.
  Unlike program1.html, this content and style of this page is rigidly specified
  and must exactly match the appearance specified in this document.>
</p>

<p>
  The text and images for this page may be copied from the recipe posted at the
  real web site: World's Healthiest Foods. Do not make the mistake of copying
  the
</p>
<h2>HTML code. Expected Appearance:</h2>
<p>
  You must match in appearance the following screen snapshot. The width of the
  screen snapshot shown below is based on a browser window width of
  approximately 1024px; if your screen is a different size, the width of your
  page will not exactly match. All line breaks are done automatically by the
  browser, except ones that are clearly much narrower than the page width.
</p>
<h2>Screen Snapshots</h2>
<p>
  program1.html screen snapshot is not included. While the content of the front
  home page is up to you, the XHTML code needs to be semantically and
  syntactically correct. Do not include any style information in the XHTML code.
  Be sure to include the top navigation bar and a link to the external css file
  program1.css for the overall style rules for the page.
</p>
<h2>recipe.html Appearance Specifications:</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>#FFCC00 body background color</td>
    <td>#000000 body font color</td>

      The font families for the page text (in order of preference) are Georgia,
      Garamond, or any serif font available on the system at the default size
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Headings:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All headings (h1, h2, etc) and table captions on the page should use a
      foreground color of #A4A400 and a background color of #F0F0F0

    <li>Other headings on the page are left-aligned</li>
    <li>The table caption should appear with a bold font weight</li>

      Tables should use a background color of #CC9933 and a text color of

    <li>
      Use a top margin of 20 pixels to add vertical spacing before each table

    images - images may be downloaded and saved in your U:\ account directly

  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>foodchart.jpg and greekgarbonzosalad.jpg (Located in zip file here)</li>
    <li>
      Note: use a relative address for your img src attribute. Do not use an
      absolute address like U:\mydocs\...
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All other decisions about styling on the page are left to the web browser.
    Any styles mentioned previously that are the same as browser defaults do not
    have to be explicitly included in your CSS stylesheet. The top of the page
    has a navigation bar with two links. The "Home" link should link to your
    program1.html page, the recipe link should link to recipe.html.html. Use
    relative URLs and assume both pages are contained in the same folder.

    Create a Third link The page should be use similar requirement as about with
    your own creative design. A basic design is displayed below

</h2>

<h2>Extra Features:</h2>
<p>
  In addition to the previous required features, you must also complete at least
  two of the following additional requirements in your recipe page. These are
  features that have been covered in lecture; the idea is that you will have to
  learn how to complete these features on your own. As much as possible, you
  should implement these changes by modifying your CSS code rather than your
  HTML.
</p>
<p>
  Here are examples of extra features: In your HTML header comment, add another
  comment saying which extra features you have completed. If you want to
  complete more than two of the extra features below, that is fine, but only two
  are required.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Image float:</b>Use CSS to make one or both images float with the
    corresponding text displayed directly to the right or left of the image
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>background:</b> Use CSS to use a background image for both pages. The
    Background image should repeat in both directions across the page and should
    not move when the page is scrolled.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Bullets:</b>Use CSS to set the bulleted lists of items on the page to use
    an appropriate image for their bullet icon rather than the normal black
    circle.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Widen headings letter spacing:</b>Use CSS to noticeably widen the letter
    spacing on all headings on the page.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Other:</b>Do you have an extra feature you'd like to add to your page
    that isn't listed here? Check with your instructor and I'll let you know if
    it is okay to substitute for one of the above.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Grading Criteria:</h2>
<p>
  Note: Program assignments are individual assignments and should represent your
  own work. You should not use pair programming on the program assignments. If
  you received help with this assignment, acknowledge this help (who helped and
  the nature of the help) in your file's header comment.
</p>
<p>
  Implement both HTML web pages using XHTML 1.0 Transitional DTD as taught in
  class. For full credit, your pages must successfully pass the W3C XHTML 1.0
  validator (SGML parser) with no errors or warnings. You should choose
  appropriate HTML tags to match the structure of the content being displayed on
  the page. Do not express stylistic information in the HTML page itself, such
  as inline styles or presentational HTML tags such as b or font.
</p>
<p>
  Express all stylistic information on the page using CSS defined in
  program1.css. For full credit, your style sheet must successfully pass the W3C
  CSS validator with no errors or warnings. You only need to worry about the
  appearance of your page in Firefox and chrome. Your pages will not be tested
  using Microsoft Internet Explorer or other browsers.
</p>
<p>
  Format your HTML and CSS nicely so that it is as readable as possible. Place a
  comment header in each file containing your account, file, and honor code.
  Include metadata on both HTML pages.
